-> Program 1 => First Come First Serve Scheduling (Non - Preemptive) <br />
-> Program 2 => Shortest job First Scheduling (Non - Preemptive) <br />
-> Program 3 => Shortest Remaining Job First Scheduling (Preemptive) <br />
-> Program 4 => Round Robin Scheduling (Non - Preemptive) <br />
-> Program 5 => Priority Scheduling (Non - Preemptive) <br />
-> Program 6 => Priority Scheduling (Preemptive) <br />
